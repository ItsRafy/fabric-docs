# Fabric Loom

Fabric Loom, or just Loom for short, is a [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
plugin for development of mods in the Fabric ecosystem. Loom provides
utilities to install Minecraft and mods in a development environment so
that you can link against them with respect to Minecraft obfuscation and
its differences between distributions and versions. It also provides run
configurations for use with Fabric Loader, Mixin compile processing and
utilities for Fabric Loader's jar-in-jar system.

### Dependency configurations

- `minecraft`: Defines the version of Minecraft to be used in the
  development environment.
- `mappings`: Defines the mappings to be used in the development
  environment.
- `modCompile`, `modImplementation`, `modApi` and `modRuntime`:
  Augmented variants of `compile`, `implementation`, `api` and
  `runtime` for mod dependencies. Will be remapped to match the
  mappings in the development environment and has any nested JARs
  removed. Nested JARs can optionally be extracted and remapped.
- `include`: Declares a dependency that should be included as a
  jar-in-jar in the `remapJar` output. This dependency configuration
  is not transitive. For non-mod dependencies, Loom will generate a
  mod JAR with a fabric.mod.json using the name as the mod ID and the
  same version.

### Default tasks

- `cleanLoomBinaries`: For the configured version of Minecraft and the
  configured mappings, deletes the merged Minecraft jar, the
  intermediary Minecraft jar and the mapped Minecraft jar from the
  user cache.
- `cleanLoomMappings`: For the configured version of Minecraft and the
  configured mappings, deletes the mappings, the intermediary
  Minecraft jar and the mapped Minecraft jar from the user cache. Also
  clears the root project build cache.
- `migrateMappings`: Migrates the current source to the specified
  mappings. See [migratemappings](../Modding-Tutorials/Advanced/migratemappings.md).
- `remapJar`: Produces a jar containing the remapped output of the
  `jar` task. Also appends any included mods for jar-in-jar.
- `genSources`: Delegates to two tasks.
  - `genSourcesDecompile` decompiles the mapped Minecraft jar using
    FernFlower to create a sources jar and additionally generates a
    linemap.
  - `genSourcesRemapLineNumbers` then applies the generated linemap
    to produce a linemapped jar which re-aligns line numbers in the
    binary and source jars. The linemapped jar replaces the mapped
    jar.
- `downloadAssets`: Downloads the asset index and asset objects for
  the configured version of Minecraft into the user cache.
- `genIdeaWorkspace`: Depends on `idea` and `genSources`. Installs run
  configurations in the IntelliJ project of the root project and
  creates the run directory if it does not already exist.
- `genEclipseRuns`: Depends on `genSources`. Installs Eclipse run
  configurations and creates the run directory if it does not already
  exist.
- `vscode`: Depends on `genSources`. Generates or overwrites a Visual
  Studio Code `launch.json` file with launch configurations in the
  `.vscode` directory and creates the run directory if it does not
  already exist.
- `remapSourcesJar`: Only exists if an AbstractArchiveTask
  `sourcesJar` exists. Remaps the output of the `sourcesJar` task in
  place.
- `runClient`: A JavaExec task to launch Fabric Loader as a Minecraft
  client.
- `runServer`: A JavaExec task to launch Fabric Loader as a Minecraft
  dedicated server.

### Default configuration

- Applies the following plugins: `java`, `eclipse` and `idea`.
- Adds the following Maven repositories: Fabric
  <https://maven.fabricmc.net/>, Mojang
  <https://libraries.minecraft.net/>, Maven Central and JCenter.
- Configures the `idea` extension to exclude directories `.gradle`,
  `build`, `.idea` and `out`, to download javadocs sources and to
  inherit output directories.
- Configures the `idea` task to be finalized by the `genIdeaWorkspace`
  task.
- Configures the `eclipse` task to be finalized by the
  `genEclipseRuns` task.
- If an `.idea` folder exists in the root project, downloads assets
  (if not up-to-date) and installs run configurations in
  `.idea/runConfigurations`.
- Adds `net.fabricmc:fabric-mixin-compile-extensions` and its
  dependencies with the `annotationProcessor` dependency
  configuration.
- Configures all non-test JavaCompile tasks with configurations for
  the Mixin annotation processor.
- Configures the `remapJar` task to output a JAR with the same name as
  the `jar` task output, then adds a "dev" classifier to the `jar`
  task.
- Configures the `remapSourcesJar` task to process the `sourcesJar`
  task output if the task exists.
- Adds the `remapJar` task and the `remapSourcesJar` task as
  dependencies of the `build` task.
- Configures the `remapJar` task and the `remapSourcesJar` task to add
  their outputs as `archives` artifacts when executed.
- For each MavenPublication (from the `maven-publish` plugin):
  - Manually appends dependencies to the POM for mod-augmented
    dependency configurations, provided the dependency configuration
    has a Maven scope.

All run configurations have the run directory `${projectDir}/run` and
the VM argument `-Dfabric.development=true`. The main classes for run
configurations is usually defined by a `fabric-installer.json` file in
the root of Fabric Loader's JAR file when it is included as a mod
dependency, but the file can be defined by any mod dependency. If no
such file is found, the main classes defaults to
`net.fabricmc.loader.launch.knot.KnotClient` and
`net.fabricmc.loader.launch.knot.KnotServer`.

The client run configuration is configured with `--assetsIndex` and
`--assetsDir` program arguments pointing to the loom cache directory
containing assets and the index file for the configured version of
Minecraft. When running on OSX, the "-XstartOnFirstThread" VM argument
is added.

### Configuration

`minecraft` extension properties:

- `runDir` (String): `"run"` by default. Defines the run directory
  used by run configurations and the `runServer` and `runClient`
  tasks.
- `refmapName` (String): `"${projectName}-refmap.json"` by default.
  Defines the name of the mixin refmap.
- `loaderLaunchMethod` (String): Empty string by default. Defines the
  method used to launch Fabric Loader in run configurations. The
  launch method used is Knot by default. If set to another value
  `method`, Loom will attempt to use read
  `fabric-installer.${method}.json` for run configurations and fall
  back to `fabric-installer.json` if none can be found. If set to
  `"launchwrapper"` and no fabric installer definitions can be found,
  run configurations will use default LaunchWrapper run configuration
  for Fabric Loader.
- `remapMod` (boolean): `true` by default. If false, disables the
  configuration of the `remapJar` task, the `remapSourcesJar` task and
  the `jar` task.
- `autoGenIDERuns` (boolean): `true` by default. If false, disables
  the automatic downloading of assets and generation of IntelliJ run
  configurations if an `.idea` folder exists in the root project.
- `extractJars` (boolean): `false` by default. If true, Loom will
  recursively extract and remap nested JARs of mod dependencies.

### Publishing

The output of the `remapJar` task is generally the artifact that should
be published, NOT the output of the `jar` task. It is important that any
publishing task using the `remapJar` task output depends on the task.
Unlike the `jar` task, the `remapJar` task is not an
AbstractArchiveTask, which means it requires extra care to set up task
dependencies correctly when integrating with plugins like CurseGradle or
`maven-publish`. The output of the `remapSourcesJar` should be used
similarly when publishing sources.

When using the `maven-publish` plugin, avoid using
`from components.java`, and instead declare artifacts as follows:

    mavenJava(MavenPublication) {
        artifact(jar.archivePath) {
            builtBy remapJar
        }
        // artifact(sourcesJar) {
        //     builtBy remapSourcesJar
        // }
        ...
    }

When publishing a project using nested jars to a Maven repository for
usage in development environments, it may be desireable to publish
artifacts without nested dependencies and instead rely on transitive
dependencies. Transitive dependencies declared in the POM are added to a
consumer's development environment by their build system with better
integration opportunities. It allows the consumer to attach sources to
transitive dependencies and requires no extra configuration to be added
to the compile and runtime classpath.

### Useful task types

- `net.fabricmc.loom.task.RemapJarTask`: Takes an input JAR and
  outputs a remapped JAR. Should be configured to depend on the task
  that produces the input JAR. This task is not an
  AbstractArchiveTask. Has the following properties:
  - `input` (Object): `null` by default. Defines the JAR file to be
    remapped. Resolved using `Project.file`.
  - `output` (Object): `null` by default. Defines the output JAR
    file. Resolved using `Project.file`.
  - `addNestedDependencies` (boolean): `false` by default. If true,
    Loom will nest dependencies added with the `include` dependency
    configuration into `META-INF/jars` in the jar and declare them
    in the fabric.mod.json file.
- `net.fabricmc.loom.task.RemapSourcesJarTask`: Takes an input Java
  sources JAR and outputs a remapped Java sources JAR. Should be
  configured to depend on the task that produces the input JAR. This
  task is not an AbstractArchiveTask. Has the following properties:
  - `input` (Object): `null` by default. Defines the sources JAR
    file to be remapped. Resolved using `Project.file`.
  - `output` (Object): `null` by default. Defines the output sources
    JAR file. Resolved using `Project.file`.
  - `targetNamespace` (String): `"intermediary"` by default. Defines
    the namespace to remap to. Remaps to intermediary as long as the
    value is not `"named"`.

### Development environment setup

Loom is designed to work out of the box by simply setting up a workspace
in the user's IDE of choice. It does quite a few things behind the
scenes to create a development environment with Minecraft:

1. Downloads the client and server jar from official channels for the
   configured version of Minecraft.
2. Merges the client and server jar to produce a merged jar with
   `@Environment` and `@EnvironmentInterface` annotations.
3. Downloads the configured mappings.
4. Remaps the merged jar with intermediary mappings to produce an
   intermediary jar.
5. Remaps the merged jar with yarn mappings to produce a mapped jar.
6. Optional: Decompiles the mapped jar to produce a mapped sources jar
   and linemap, and applies the linemap to the mapped jar.
7. Adds dependencies of Minecraft.
8. Downloads Minecraft assets.
9. Processes and includes mod-augmented dependencies (and optionally
   extracts and remaps nested JARs).

### Caches

- `${GRADLE_HOME}/caches/fabric-loom`: The user cache, a cache shared
  by all Loom projects for a user. Used to cache Minecraft assets,
  jars, merged jars, intermediary jars and mapped jars.
- `.gradle/loom-cache`: The root project persistent cache, a cache
  shared by a project and its subprojects. Used to cache remapped mods
  as well as generated included mod JARs.
- `build/loom-cache`: The root project build cache.
- `**/build/loom-cache`: The (sub)project build cache.
