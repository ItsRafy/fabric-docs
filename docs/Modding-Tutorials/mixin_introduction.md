# Introduction to Mixins

Mixins are a powerful and important tool used in the Fabric ecosystem.
Their primary use case is modifying existing code in the base game,
whether it be through injecting custom logic, removing mechanics, or
modifying values.

For a complete walkthrough on Mixin functionality, usage, and mechanics,
view [the Mixin Official
Wiki](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin/wiki). Additional
documentation can be found in [the Mixin
Javadoc](https://jenkins.liteloader.com/view/Other/job/Mixin/javadoc/index.html).
The Fabric Wiki also offers several articles that provide practical
