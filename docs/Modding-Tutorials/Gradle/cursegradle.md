# Publishing mods on CurseForge with CurseGradle

To familiarize yourself with CurseGradle, please read the [project's
official wiki](https://github.com/matthewprenger/CurseGradle/wiki).

Note: in recent versions, it seems that the changes outlined in this
article are not necessary and perhaps even harmful.

## Fabric-specific changes

(Note: Last updated for Loom 0.2.5.)

The additions necessary for usage with Fabric have been highlighted in
green. If you are using Loom 0.2.5 `remapJar.output` should be just
`remapJar` instead.

They are, in order:

- `afterEvaluate { ... }` - Loom's remapJar tweaks currently happen
  after evaluation, and as such remapJar.output can only be read then,
- `mainArtifact(remapJar)` (or `mainArtifact(remapJar.output)` for
  Loom 0.2.4 and earlier) - the primary artifact submitted to
  CurseForge should be the output of remapJar, that is the remapped
  (production-ready) mod .JAR file,
- `uploadTask.dependsOn(remapJar)` - make sure that the CurseForge
  upload task only runs once the remapped JAR has been built,
- `forgeGradleIntegration = false` - as you're not using ForgeGradle,
  that specific integration has to be disabled.

Note: CurseGradle does not set the mod loader version to fabric and does
not add java 10 to supported java versions even if you enable newer java
version support.
