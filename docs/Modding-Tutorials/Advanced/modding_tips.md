# Modding Tips

Here's a collection of assorted Fabric-related modding tips gleaned from
experiences on advising users of the API.

## Basics (API)

- Due to the injection-based approach of Fabric's API development, we
  don't tend to patch classes outright in a way visible to the end
  user. As such, you may occasionally find Fabric extensions of
  vanilla classes when you run into something you cannot do. For
  example:
  - Block.Settings -&gt; FabricBlockSettings
  - EntityType.Builder -&gt; FabricEntityTypeBuilder
- While an official configuration system is being worked on, one
  replacement for now is to use Java .properties or JSON.
- For a built-in resource pack or data pack, please ensure that an
  "assets/\[mod id\]" or "data/\[mod id\]" directory path is present,
  respectively! IDEA users might find themselves accidentally creating
  an "assets.\[mod id\]" directory - this won't work.

## Mixins

- To cast a class to an interface it doesn't implement, or cast a
  final class, or cast the mixin to your target class, you can use the
  "(TargetClass) (Object) sourceClassObject" trick.
- @Redirect and @ModifyConstant mixins cannot currently be nested
  (applied by more than one mod in the same area at the same time).
  This might change later in development - however, for now, alongside
  @Overwrite, please avoid them if possible (or discuss bringing the
  hook over to Fabric's API, or - for more niche things - consider
  putting it in a JAR-in-JAR once that's out).
- If you're adding custom fields or methods, especially if they're not
  attached to an interface - prefix them with "\[modid\]\_" or another
  unique string. Essentially, "mymod\_secretValue" instead of
  "secretValue". This is to avoid conflicts between mods adding a
  field or method named the same way!

## Networking

- Packets always begin execution on the **network thread**, however
  accesses to most Minecraft things are not thread-safe. In general,
  if you're not exactly sure what you're doing, you want to parse the
  packet on the network thread (read all the values out), then use the
  **task queue** to perform additional operations on the **main
  server/client thread**.

## Pitfalls

- Avoid using the `java.awt` package and its subpackages. AWT does not
  work well on all systems. Several users have reported that it hangs
  Minecraft.
