# FabLabs

[FabLabs](https://github.com/FabLabsMC) is a GitHub organization for
staging and testing new Fabric features before submitting them as pull
requests. FabLabs projects are experimental and tend to focus more on
snapshots than core Fabric API.

### Joining FabLabs

Currently, the only way to join FabLabs is by asking the FabLabs admins.
Send a message to @B0undarybreaker\#2106 on Discord or b0undarybreaker
on EsperNet asking to join. You must provide your GitHub username or
email so we can add you. Eventually, there may be a form to fill out to
join more easily.

### FabLabs Tools

\- [Blueprint](https://github.com/FabLabsMC/Blueprint) is a template
repository for creating new Fabric API modules. It includes automatic CI
integration for publishing builds on GitHub package registry.

### FabLabs Guidelines

\- FabLabs was created for adding better staging to Fabric development.
FabLabs projects should be experimental additions to the Fabric API and
ecosystem.

\- FabLabs projects should generally either target snapshot versions of
Minecraft or be version-agnostic. Projects which include breaking
changes to Fabric API \*must\* target snapshot versions of Minecraft.

\- FabLabs projects must be licensed to be compatible with the Fabric
project they are built for, so it's possible to merge them in.

\- FabLabs may not be used for the purposes of starting or continuing
intra-community drama. Be mature with your contributions.

\- Repeated violations of these guidelines may result in being removed
or blacklisted from the organization.
