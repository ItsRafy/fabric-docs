# Known issues ("growing pains")

There are some issues, particularly in the Gradle plugin, which we have
identified but not yet managed to fully fix.

## Gradle Plugin

Please note that most of them appear primarily on Windows machines.

- **AccessDeniedException** with JAR files in Gradle: This most
  commonly happens because IntelliJ IDEA's Gradle daemon holds on to a
  file handle in a place we haven't yet identified. The workaround is
  to quit IDEA, re-generate the IDEA project as outlined in the setup
  instructions, then re-open the resulting project and only perform
  Gradle activities through the command line.
- **NoClassDefFoundError caused by NullPointerException in
  org.objectweb.asm.ClassReader** while loading game in dev
  environment: Run `gradlew cleanLoomBinaries` followed by
  `gradlew idea` to regenerate the JAR file. Again, the JAR file gets
  flushed prematurely.
