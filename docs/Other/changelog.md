  Mojang took liberties with the amount of refactors this time around.
- **\[API\]** Crash reports now list the mods installed.
- **\[API\]** Entity registration has been fixed - albeit you should
  use FabricEntityTypeBuilder in place of EntityType.Builder.
- **\[Loom\]** Fixed runClient/runServer not working right with
  mixins! At last!

- **\[API\]** Added FabricEntityTypeBuilder and EntityTrackingRegistry
  for registering custom server-&gt;client synchronization rules.
- **\[Enigma\]** Fixed very annoying bug with renaming method
  arguments in interfaces.

  and other special characters not working correctly.
