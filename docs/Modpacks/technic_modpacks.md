# Using Technic for Fabric modpacks

1. Open the [Fabric download  page](https://fabricmc.net/use/?page=technic).
2. Use the button to download `version.json` and put it in a `bin`
   directory in your modpack ZIP.  
   **NOTE** The `version.json` will be the *only* file in bin/. If
   other guides tell you to add additional files to bin/, you're
   probably safe to just ignore that part and keep going.
3. That's it! Do the rest the Technic way.

**PSA** Technic's support of 1.13+ profiles is a bit wonky, and we do a
workaround to make it work. As such, no guarantees on our side can or
will be made about its functioning.
