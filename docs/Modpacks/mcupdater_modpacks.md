# Fabric MCUpdater Modpack Support

## Installing MCUpdater (User)

Just download MCUpdater from [mcupdater.com](https://mcupdater.com/)! To
add modpacks, press the "+" in the top-left corner and insert the .XML
modpack definition URL provided by the modpack creator. To update a
modpack, press "Update"; keep in mind launching Minecraft does not
automatically update the modpack.

## Creating a Modpack (The Easy Way)

### Prerequisities

- Publicly accessible HTTP web server,
- Familiarity with the terminal or command line, mostly! No GUIs here,
  sorry.

### Steps

1. Prepare your modpack directory (config/, mods/, ...)
2. Download
   [MCU-FastPack-latest.jar](http://files.mcupdater.com/MCU-FastPack-latest.jar)
3. Run the following command:

<!-- --->

    java -jar MCU-FastPack-latest.jar --path MODPACK_PATH --baseURL HTTP_WEB_SERVER_URL --mc MC_VERSION --fabric //FABRIC_VERSION// --out XML_FILE

, where:

      * //MODPACK_PATH// is the location of the modpack files created in the first step,
      * //HTTP_WEB_SERVER_URL// is the upload location URL (for instance, http://example.com/modpack/),
      * //MC_VERSION// is the Minecraft version (for instance, 18w50a),
      * //FABRIC_VERSION// is the Fabric Loader version (for instance, 0.3.6.107 - check with the site to find the latest!),
      * //XML_FILE// is the output XML filename.
    - Upload the modpack files created in the first step as to make them visible beneath //HTTP_WEB_SERVER_URL//,
    - Upload the XML file to your HTTP web server URL - the location and filename does not matter other than for linking users. If you want to update the modpack later, just replace that XML file in the same location!

You're done! You now have an MCUpdater Fabric modpack.

    - Visit [[https://fabricmc.net/use|https://fabricmc.net/use]], select the desired Fabric loader versions and click "copy MCUpdater <Import> Entry".
    - Open the XML file in your favourite editor of choice and perform two changes (example provided below):
      - Add the entry copied from the previous step below <Server...>: it will look like <Import url="...">fabric</Import>.
      - Add the following attribute to the <Server> element: mainClass="net.fabricmc.loader.launch.knot.KnotClient".
    - Upload the modpack files created in the first step as to make them visible beneath //HTTP_WEB_SERVER_URL//,
    - Upload the XML file to your HTTP web server URL - the location and filename does not matter other than for linking users. If you want to update the modpack later, just replace that XML file in the same location!

You're done! You now have an MCUpdater Fabric modpack.
