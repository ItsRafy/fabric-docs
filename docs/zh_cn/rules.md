  you have a good working knowledge of the area, chances are you'll
  just name things the same anyway as it'll make the most sense to you
  due to habit. There are some exceptions in areas where things have
  become common modding lingo (I mean, we all call blocks "Blocks" and
  worlds "Worlds") and obvious terms (there aren't many good ways to
  say "add(Object)"), but when in doubt - it's best not to map it.
  There's many people involved, someone will do it anyway.
- If you're porting an area of the code from Forge or other mod
  loaders, **DO NOT SIMPLY RE-USE THOSE NAMES IN YARN**. After all,
  those names are Voldemap. In practice, you should ideally tell
  people either (a) what Yarn names you need mapped (say,
  "class\_351") or (b) what behaviour you need mapped in descriptive
  terms (say, "the method which controls providing the block collision
  box").
- **DO NOT POST VOLDEMAP NAMES IN THE CHAT**. All you achieve that way
  is make more people know those names, which means they now have
  trouble contributing them!
- Anyone found ripping mappings from MCP at a scale where it is
  possible to prove may be permanently banned from contributing to the
  mappings. You have been warned. We can't take risks here.
