# Setting up a mod development environment

## Prerequisites


* A Java Development Kit (JDK) for Java 8 or newer https://adoptopenjdk.net/
* Any IDE, for example [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).


## Steps


- Copy the starting files from [fabric-example-mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod) (or from [the Kotlin version](https://github.com/natanfudge/fabric-example-mod-kotlin), if you wish to use Kotlin,) excluding the ''LICENSE'' and ''README.md'' files - as those apply to the template itself, not necessarily to your mod.
- Edit ''gradle.properties'':
    * Make sure to set ''archives_base_name'' and ''maven_group'' to your preferred values.
    * Make sure to update the versions of Minecraft, the mappings and the loader - all of which can be queried through [this website](https://modmuss50.me/fabric.html) - to match the versions you wish to target.
    * Add any other dependencies you plan to use in ''build.gradle''.
- Import the project to your IDE. Follow [these instructions](../other/vscode_setup.md) to import the project to Visual Studio Code.
- Run the ''genSources'' Gradle task. If your IDE doesn't have Gradle integration, then run the following command in the terminal: ''./gradlew genSources''.
- If you would like to have the IDE run configs you can run following commands:
    * For IntelliJ IDEA: ''./gradlew idea''. 
    * For Eclipse: ''./gradlew eclipse''. 
    * If you use VS Code, configurations were generated at the step 3.
- Happy modding!


## Getting started

Try [adding an item](items/item.md) or [a block](blocks-and-block-entities/block.md). Itâ€™s also a good idea to visit [Applying changes without restarting Minecraft](development-tools/applychanges.md).

## Advice

* While Fabric API is not strictly necessary for developing mods, its

  primary goal is to provide cross-compatibility and hooks where the

  game engine does not, and as such it is highly recommended!

* As Fabric is in early development, occasionally, with development of

  fabric-loom \(our Gradle build plugin\) issues may crop up which

  require a manual clearing \(deleting\) of the cache \(which can be

  found in `.gradle/caches/fabric-loom`\). Those will generally be

  announced as they are identified.

* Don't hesitate to ask questions! We're here to help you and work

  with you to make your dream mod a reality.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing sounds

Sometimes, when importing the Gradle project into an IDE, the assets might not download correctly. In this case, run the `downloadAssets` task manually - either using IDE's built-in menu or by simply running `gradlew downloadAssets`.
